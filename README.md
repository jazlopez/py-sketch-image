# py-sketch-image
Generate sketch version from images. It uses python3 and OpenCV to create sketch version of your image.

It works by creating a gray version of your image and applying a sketch effect to the new file. Sketch version of your image will be stored at the same directory of original image.

* Original image is not affected at all.

Example:

### ORIGINAL

  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jazlopez/py-sketch-image/master/source.jpg">

#### SKETCH

  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jazlopez/py-sketch-image/master/sketch_source.jpg">



#### 1. INSTALLATION

```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

#### 2. USAGE

Run sketch.py providing the path of the image you want to sketch.

```
python3 sketch.py /image/path/to/sketch
```
